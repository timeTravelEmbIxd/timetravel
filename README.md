# The Living Wish Experiment
Since the beginning of time humans have fantasized about time travel. Time travel is not really about a machine that can travel through time, not yet. The machine that can travel through time is not an assemblage of parts that work together to perform a function. Until such a machine if ever is invented, the real time machine is the human imagination.
This experiment investigates a concept and the prototype for an interactive and embodied art installation that enables the users to travel through time within their own imagination. The installation is based on defamiliarization as a disorientation technique which is used to actively engage the users’ imagination, provoking rich embodied experiences. 

This repo contains the code for the technical part of the installation (WebApp, SpeechRecognition, ProcessingLoader and Arduino).
